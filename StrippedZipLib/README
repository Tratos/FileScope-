This is a miniaturized version of ICSharpCode's SharpZipLib with some hacks.

Here are the changes:

Took out SharpZLibTestCases/, BZip2/, GZip/, Tar/, ZipConstants.cs, ZipEntry.cs, ZipFile.cs, ZipInputStream.cs, ZipOutputStream.cs

ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib/Zip/Compression/Streams/InflaterInputStream.cs:
	Fill() return type is now bool instead of void... it returns true if the defalted stream doesn't end early
	Read(byte[] b, int off, int len) returns -5 when the deflated stream ends early

ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib/AssemblyInfo.cs:
	Now the assembly title is StrippedZipLib
	Also, AssemblyDelaySign and AssemblyKeyFile attributes are commented out

ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib/Main.cs:
	Took out "using ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.BZip2" and code in Main(string[] args)
