Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FileScope is a cross-platform, multi-network P2P application written in C#.
The main P2P protocol of focus for this project is Gnutella2. This is a very
efficient program, with an elaborate interface filled with a respectable
amount of features.


Protocols & Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Complete support for Gnutella, Gnutella2, eDonkey, and OpenNap.
Currently only runs on Windows and requires testing and bug fixing.
Only the core (non-GUI) portion runs on UNIX based systems with Mono. This
issue should be alleviated when the SWF implementation in Mono is finished.
