fix these bugs:

"no pushed servent found" occuring when downloading (DownloadManager.cs)
"GetType: Illegal characters in path." (UniQueryHit.cs)
multiple g2 "qka ???????" errors (Messages.cs)... maybe collection cleaning too frequent? ("hubCache removed" in HostCache.cs)
------------------------------
near releases:

do beta testing of all filescope features
implement /QH2/HG, /QH2/H/URL, /QH2/H/G in g2
tiger tree hashing
support all types of hashes everywhere (this is tricky... contact Matt at mz392@nyu.edu before attempting)
preview download feature
change the mp3 info column header in the seach view into a "media info" header
download mesh with g1/g2 protocols
------------------------------
future releases:

draw better icons
embed progress bars into downloads/uploads listviews
make a message box that doesn't beep
time left ("ETA") feature to uploads/downloads
wait for Mono's SWF implementation to be finished so that this app could run on linux
xml support in g2
